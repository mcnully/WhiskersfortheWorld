					<p class="lead">Our Pastor shares many of the core attributes of the many Gospel Men that have come before us. Their love of the Gospel; their desire that the world might know Jesus; and their untiring investment in other's lives. This year's purpose for the funds is to provide a scholarship for fellow brothers and sisters of our <a href="http://www.visionbaptistcobbcounty.com/">sister Church</a> that would like to attend the <a href="https://www.visionmissions.com/events/summit/">Summit</a></p>
					<p class="lead">So, 100% of the proceeds from your pledges for Austin Gardner's No-Shave November will go to benefit this awesome cause and excite,engage, and empower more to focus on the Gospel being spread further around the world.</p>
